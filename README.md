# What can data tell us about city employees' payroll

## Goal
To analyse city's payroll database and see who is making the most in overtime, which agencies are spending the most in overtime, who are the highest paid employees overall.

## Data source
[Citywide Payroll Data (Fiscal Year)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e/data) from 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021

## Analyses
Check [this notebook](https://github.com/areenaarora/city-employees-salaries/blob/main/Analyzing%20payroll.ipynb) for the analyses.\ The notebook has comments to guide you through the process

## Initial findings

- In 2021, NYCHA Supervisor Plumber Robert Procida made nearly $250K in overtime. The agency had 52 plumbers on its payroll in 2021 and together they made over $2 million in overtime. Including all other pay, they made over $4 million.

- One employee, David Johnson, a Correction Officer worked over 4000 hours each year (more than anyone else) and worked less than 650 hours in overtime each year.

- On the other extreme, there are employees who reportedly worked over 2500 hours in overtime and 258 employees who worked at least one hour more in overtime than regular hours. Of this subset, 129 employees are no longer on city payroll. What does this look like? Consider Kevin Murtha, a Lieutenant with NYPD. In 2020, he worked 665 regular hours and nearly 2,450 hours in overtime. This translated into around $162,000 in overtime pay.

## Initial Reporting questions
1. How do agencies audit overtime pay?
2. How are there people in the database with negative regular work hours?
3. How normal are the disparities in overtime pay?
4. What factors does overtime depend on?
5. What all is included in "other pay?"
